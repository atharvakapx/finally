## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Pre-roadmap: Market data subsystem (`backend/app/market/`) is the canonical interface — no reimplementation; all new backend code consumes `PriceCache` and `MarketDataSource`
- Pre-roadmap: SSE over WebSockets, SQLite over Postgres, market orders only, GPT-4.1-mini via LiteLLM, LLM auto-execution without confirmation
